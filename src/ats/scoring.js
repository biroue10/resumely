// ApplyCraft ATS Readiness Score — centralized, documented scoring rules.
//
// IMPORTANT, READ FIRST:
// This score is an ApplyCraft HEURISTIC. It rewards resume structure, content,
// formatting, and keyword practices that commonly help a resume be parsed and
// ranked. It does NOT reproduce the private algorithms of Workday, Greenhouse,
// Taleo, Lever, or any specific applicant tracking system, and it does NOT
// guarantee that a candidate will get an interview. Every ATS differs.
//
// The score starts at 100 and subtracts a fixed number of points per issue,
// by severity. Keeping the weights here (one place) means the standalone ATS
// checker, the live in-builder score, and the static SEO page can never drift.
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
