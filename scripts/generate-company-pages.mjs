    content: `
<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="meta">Last updated: ${TODAY} · Effective immediately</p>
<p class="lead">ApplyCraft is designed to handle as little of your data as possible. The free builder is browser-first by default, while optional online features process selected data only when you choose to use them.</p>

<div class="callout"><p>⚡ <strong style="color:#E4EBF5">Short version:</strong> Free builder data is stored in your browser by default. If you use optional features such as cloud sync, accounts, AI helpers, or private offline sharing, selected data may be stored or processed so those features can work. ApplyCraft does not send résumé content to analytics.</p></div>

<h2>1. Who we are</h2>
<p>ApplyCraft is an independent product built and operated by Biroue Digital Ltd (<a href="mailto:${EMAIL}">${EMAIL}</a>). This website is accessible at <strong>applycraft.io</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="data-we-collect">2. What data we collect</h2>
<h3>2.1 Resume and cover letter content</h3>
<p>By default, resume and cover-letter data is edited and stored only in your own browser. ApplyCraft does not require an account, and user-written content is not sent to or stored on our servers unless you explicitly use an optional online feature below.</p>

<h3 id="optional-account">2.4 Optional account and Master Profile sync</h3>
<p>You may optionally provide an email address to save your <strong>Master Profile</strong> and sync it across your devices. This is entirely optional — the resume builder, all templates, and PDF/DOCX export work fully without it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sign-in is passwordless: we email you a one-time link. We store your email address and, with your explicit consent, your Master Profile content so it can be synced.</li>
  <li>Master Profile cloud sync is a paid feature (see section 4a). The free builder never requires an account.</li>
  <li>You can delete all of this at any time using <strong>"Delete my saved data"</strong> in the app, or by emailing us. Deletion removes your account, stored Master Profile, and session.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Technical logs</h3>
<p>Our hosting provider (Cloudflare) may record standard server access logs: IP address, browser type, URL requested, and timestamp. These are retained for up to 30 days for security and uptime monitoring. We do not use them for analytics or advertising.</p>

<h3>2.3 Uploaded files</h3>
<p>If you upload a PDF or DOCX resume using the upload feature, the intended behavior is browser-side processing. Avoid uploading sensitive documents if you are using a modified build or third-party mirror of ApplyCraft.</p>

<h3>2.4 Private offline share links</h3>
<p>Private offline share links store the document data inside the URL fragment. Anyone with the full link can view the document, so only share it with people you trust. These links do not require server-side document storage, but they can be long.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">3. Cookies and tracking</h2>
<p>ApplyCraft sets <strong>no advertising cookies</strong> and uses <strong>no cross-site tracking</strong> (no Google Analytics, no Facebook Pixel, no Hotjar, no ad networks). We use privacy-friendly, <strong>cookieless</strong> product analytics (Plausible) that counts anonymous, aggregated usage events (such as "a resume was started or exported"). These events contain no personal data — no names, emails, or resume content.</p>
<p>Cloudflare, our CDN provider, may set a technical cookie (<code>__cf_bm</code>) for bot protection. This is a strictly necessary security cookie that does not track you for advertising purposes.</p>

<h2>4. AI features and your data</h2>
<p>Some optional AI helpers — such as achievement coaching or AI tailoring to a job description — depend on external AI providers when you choose to use them. User-written résumé or cover-letter content is not translated, uploaded, or processed by AI unless you explicitly choose an AI-powered action. Do not use optional AI helpers with sensitive content unless you are comfortable with the relevant provider processing the submitted text. The core builder and export do not use AI.</p>

<h2 id="payments">4a. Payments (optional paid pass)</h2>
<p>Power-ups (AI tailoring and Master Profile cloud sync) are available via an optional one-time "Active Search Pass." Payments are processed by <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong>, which acts as the merchant of record and handles billing and applicable taxes. We do not receive or store your full card details; we record only whether your pass is active and when it expires. Lemon Squeezy's handling of payment data is governed by its own privacy policy.</p>

<h2 id="gdpr">5. GDPR and your rights</h2>
<p>ApplyCraft is designed to minimize account-based storage of resume content. For privacy-related requests or questions about data handled by the site, contact us at <a href="mailto:${EMAIL}">${EMAIL}</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Union, the United Kingdom, or another jurisdiction with data protection laws, you have the following rights:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Right of access</strong> — you can ask what personal information is associated with support requests or other direct contact.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to erasure</strong> — you can request deletion of personal information retained through direct contact.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> — download your resume as PDF or DOCX at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to object</strong> — we do not process your data for profiling, advertising, or automated decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any privacy-related request, contact us at <a href="mailto:${EMAIL}">${EMAIL}</a>. We respond within 72 hours.</p>

<h2>6. Data retention</h2>
<p>For the free, no-account builder we do not store your active résumé content on our servers by default. If you opt into Master Profile sync, we retain your email and stored Master Profile until you delete them via "Delete my saved data" or by contacting us. Cloudflare access logs are automatically deleted after 30 days. If you contact us by email, your email and its contents are retained only for as long as necessary to respond.</p>

<h2>7. Children's privacy</h2>
<p>ApplyCraft is not directed at children under 13 (or 16 in the EU). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has submitted data, contact us and we will take appropriate action.</p>

<h2>8. Third-party services</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> — CDN and hosting. Subject to Cloudflare's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> — typography. Font files are served from Google's CDN. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener">Google's privacy policy</a>. No personal data is shared.</li>
  <li><strong>Plausible Analytics</strong> — cookieless, privacy-friendly product analytics. No personal data, no cross-site tracking. Subject to <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy" rel="noopener">Plausible's privacy policy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong> — payment processing and merchant of record for the optional paid pass. Subject to <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/privacy" rel="noopener">Lemon Squeezy's privacy policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p>All traffic to applycraft.io is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS. The free builder holds no personal data on our servers. For opted-in accounts we store only your email and Master Profile content, which you can delete at any time, keeping our data footprint minimal.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy. The "Last updated" date at the top will reflect any changes. Continued use of ApplyCraft after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
<p>Privacy questions, concerns, or GDPR requests: <a href="mailto:${EMAIL}">${EMAIL}</a>.</p>
<p>We typically respond within 72 hours.</p>

    content: `
<h1>About ApplyCraft</h1>
<p class="lead">ApplyCraft is a resume and cover letter builder for people who need a polished document quickly, without surrendering their career data, fighting a paywall, or learning a complicated design tool.</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>ApplyCraft is built and operated by Biroue Digital Ltd. We created it after seeing the same pattern across too many resume builders: users spend time entering personal details, then discover that downloading, removing a watermark, or using a useful template requires payment or an account.</p>
<p>ApplyCraft takes the opposite approach. The core builder is fast, useful, and available before you create an account. Your resume should feel like your document from the first minute, not a file being held hostage until checkout.</p>
<p>ApplyCraft is independent. It is not built around advertising profiles, hidden resume databases, or forced cloud storage. The product is designed around a simple standard: help job seekers create better applications with less friction.</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p>📬 Want to reach us? Email: <a href="mailto:${EMAIL}">${EMAIL}</a></p>
</div>

<h2>The mission</h2>
<p>A strong resume should not be a luxury purchase. For many roles, your document has to satisfy two audiences at once: automated screening software and the human recruiter who reads the shortlist. Bad formatting, unclear sections, weak phrasing, or the wrong language can cost an interview before your experience is properly considered.</p>
<p>ApplyCraft exists to make that first step fairer. Students, career changers, international applicants, and experienced professionals should all have access to clean templates, practical writing support, and export formats that are ready to send.</p>

<h2>Why ApplyCraft stands out</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No sign-up wall.</strong> You can start building, previewing, and exporting without handing over an email address first.</li>
  <li><strong>No watermarked downloads.</strong> Your resume exports as a professional document, not an advertisement for the tool that made it.</li>
  <li><strong>Browser-first by design.</strong> The main resume workflow runs in your browser, reducing unnecessary server storage of personal career information.</li>
  <li><strong>ATS-conscious templates.</strong> Layouts use readable typography, clear section labels, and text-based structure so applicant tracking systems can parse the document more reliably.</li>
  <li><strong>Global by default.</strong> ApplyCraft lets candidates write in any language, with production-ready English, French, and Arabic document labels, right-to-left layouts, and separate interface/document language choices.</li>
  <li><strong>Resume and cover letter together.</strong> You can build matching application documents instead of piecing together separate files from different tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional AI helpers.</strong> Writing and tailoring helpers are available when useful, but the core builder does not depend on AI or force it into the workflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Practical exports.</strong> Download PDF or DOCX files you can submit directly, share with recruiters, or keep as your own editable records.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Built for real job searches</h2>
<p>ApplyCraft is not trying to be a generic document editor. It is focused on the specific work of building applications: structuring experience, highlighting measurable achievements, matching a resume and cover letter visually, and keeping the final file clean enough for both software screening and human review.</p>
<p>That focus is what makes the product different. Instead of giving you a blank page and dozens of decorative choices, ApplyCraft gives you guided sections, proven resume patterns, and export-ready templates that keep momentum on the job search itself.</p>

<h2>Technical stack</h2>
<p>ApplyCraft is a React application built with Vite. PDF generation runs in the browser using jsPDF and html2canvas. DOCX generation uses docx.js. The free builder is intentionally lightweight so the product stays fast, accessible, and easy to use from a modern browser.</p>
<p>The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages and deployed automatically from the production codebase.</p>

    content: `
<h1>Help Center</h1>
<p class="lead">Find answers to common questions below. If you don't see what you need, email <a href="mailto:${EMAIL}">${EMAIL}</a> and we'll reply within 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<h3>How do I start building my resume?</h3>
<p>Click "Build My Resume" on the homepage. You'll be taken to the template selector — pick a template and you're in the editor. No account or sign-up required.</p>

<h3>Do I need to create an account?</h3>
<p>No. Open the app, build your resume, and download it. The core builder does not require an email, password, or account profile.</p>

<h3>Is ApplyCraft really free?</h3>
<p>The current builder is free to use and does not require a credit card. If pricing changes in the future, the free workflow should remain clear before you invest time in a document.</p>

<h2>Templates</h2>

<h3>How do I change my template?</h3>
<p>Click "Templates" in the left sidebar. Choose a new template and your current data will transfer automatically.</p>

<h3>Are the templates ATS-friendly?</h3>
<p>The templates are designed with clean, text-based layouts that improve parsing compatibility: clear section labels, readable typography, and no image-only resume text.</p>

<h3>Can I preview a template before using it?</h3>
<p>Yes. On the template selection screen, hovering over a template shows a live preview of the layout.</p>

<h2>Editing your resume</h2>

<h3>How do I add more work experience or education entries?</h3>
<p>Click the "+ Add" button at the bottom of the Experience or Education section. You can add as many entries as needed.</p>

<h3>How do I reorder sections or entries?</h3>
<p>Click and drag the handle icon (⋮⋮) on the left of any entry to reorder it.</p>

<h3>Can I add a photo to my resume?</h3>
<p>Yes — click the photo upload area in the header section. Note: photos are not recommended for US, Canadian, or UK resumes due to anti-discrimination hiring practices.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<h3>How do I change the resume language?</h3>
<p>Use the document language selector in the builder. Changing document language localizes standard section labels, date formats, document direction, and export metadata. It does not translate your written résumé or cover-letter content.</p>

<h3>Does ApplyCraft support Arabic and other RTL languages?</h3>
<p>Arabic is production-ready for interface text, document labels, and RTL-aware layouts. Other RTL languages use the same direction-aware rendering where available, but English, French, and Arabic are the currently production-ready localized languages.</p>

<h3>Does changing document language translate my existing resume?</h3>
<p>Changing document language does not automatically translate your professional summary, experience descriptions, job titles, skills, education details, or cover-letter paragraphs. User-written content is not translated, uploaded, or processed by AI unless you explicitly choose an AI-powered action.</p>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<h3>How do I download my resume as a PDF?</h3>
<p>Click "Download PDF" in the top bar. Your resume is generated in the browser and saved directly to your computer.</p>

<h3>How do I download as DOCX (Word)?</h3>
<p>Click the arrow next to "Download PDF" and choose "Download DOCX".</p>

<h3>Why does my downloaded PDF look slightly different from the preview?</h3>
<p>PDF rendering uses html2canvas to convert the live preview. Minor font or spacing differences can occur across browsers. Google Chrome typically gives the most accurate output.</p>

<h2>Privacy and data</h2>

<h3>Where is my resume data stored?</h3>
<p>Free builder data is stored in your browser by default. If you use optional features such as cloud sync, accounts, AI helpers, or private offline sharing, selected data may be stored or processed so those features can work. ApplyCraft does not send résumé content to analytics.</p>

<h3>Is my data used to train AI?</h3>
<p>User-written résumé or cover-letter content is not translated, uploaded, or processed by AI unless you explicitly choose an AI-powered action. Avoid optional AI helpers for sensitive content unless you are comfortable with that processing.</p>

<h3>How do I delete my data?</h3>
<p>Use the local data controls in the app or clear this site's browser storage. Closing a tab does not always remove local drafts stored by your browser.</p>

<h3>How do private offline share links work?</h3>
<p>Private offline share links store the document data inside the URL fragment. Anyone with the full link can view the document, so only share it with people you trust. These links do not require server-side document storage, but they can be long.</p>

<h2>🚀 Shipping soon</h2>

<div class="roadmap-item">
  <h3>AI resume parsing from uploaded file</h3>
  <p>Upload your existing PDF or DOCX and have ApplyCraft automatically pre-fill the form with your work history, skills, and education — all locally in the browser.</p>
</div>

<div class="roadmap-item">
  <h3>Job description keyword matching</h3>
  <p>Paste a job posting and see which keywords in your resume match and which are missing. Use the result as a tailoring signal, not as a guarantee of ATS success or interviews.</p>
</div>

<div class="roadmap-item">
  <h3>Resume saving to browser storage</h3>
  <p>Opt-in local persistence using localStorage — save multiple resume versions in your browser without any server involved.</p>
</div>

<h2>📋 In progress</h2>

<div class="roadmap-item">
  <h3>Grammar &amp; spelling check (multilingual)</h3>
  <p>Real-time spell checking in the resume form, supporting French, Arabic, Spanish, German, and English.</p>

</div>

<div class="roadmap-item">
  <h3>Short public share links</h3>
  <p>Short public links are planned for later. They will require storing a copy of the shared document and will include a clear privacy notice before creation.</p>
</div>

<div class="roadmap-item">
  <h3>Private offline share links</h3>
  <p>Current: private offline share links are available using URL fragments. They do not require server-side document storage, but the links can be long.</p>
</div>

<div class="roadmap-item">
  <h3>Cover letter AI generation</h3>
  <p>Generate a role-specific cover letter based on your resume content and a pasted job description.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:48px">Uptime</h2>
<p>ApplyCraft is served through Cloudflare infrastructure, but this page is not connected to automated uptime monitoring yet.</p>
<p>The free builder is browser-first, so core editing and export continue locally after the app has loaded. Network access is still required to load the site and optional online features.</p>
