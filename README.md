<div align="center">
<img src="docs/screenshots/09_privacy_cta.png" alt="Your resume data stays yours. Always." width="540"/>
</div>

<br/>

- **No account required** — nothing to sign up for, nothing to leak
- **Privacy-conscious design** — no analytics on resume content
- **Browser-side export** — PDF and DOCX generated in your browser, never uploaded
- **Clear your session anytime** — one click wipes everything locally

> **Note on AI features:** When AI achievement coaching is enabled (requires an Anthropic API key — see below), the text you submit for rewriting is sent to Anthropic's API. No other resume data is transmitted. When no API key is configured the feature falls back silently to the live preview — nothing leaves the browser.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | React 18 |
| Build tool | Vite 6 + vite-react-ssg (static prerendering) |
| Styling | CSS-in-JS + shared `_seo.css` for static pages |
| PDF export | jsPDF (lazy-loaded) |
| DOCX export | docx.js (lazy-loaded) |
| HTML sanitisation | DOMPurify |
| AI | Anthropic Claude API (optional — see below) |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages |
| CDN | Cloudflare global network |

---

## How the AI works

The achievement-coaching feature calls the Anthropic Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) directly from the browser:

```js
fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", "x-api-key": YOUR_KEY },
  body: JSON.stringify({ model: "claude-sonnet-4-6", max_tokens: 1000, messages: [...] }),
})
```

**Three things to know:**

1. **No key = graceful fallback.** If the API key is missing or the call fails, the app silently falls back to the live-preview data. Nothing breaks.
2. **Key handling.** The key should never be hardcoded in front-end code. For production, route the call through a Cloudflare Worker or other serverless function that holds the key as an environment secret, and point the `fetch` in `src/ResumeGenerator.jsx` at that Worker URL instead.
3. **What gets sent.** Only the text fields you explicitly submit for rewriting are sent to the API. Your resume is not silently uploaded in the background.

## Run locally

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/biroue10/applycraft.git
cd applycraft

# 2. Install dependencies (Node 20+ required)
npm install

# 3. Start dev server
npm run dev
# → opens at http://localhost:5173
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build      # SSG build → dist/
npm run preview    # serve the dist/ locally
```

The build uses `vite-react-ssg` to prerender the landing page as real HTML so Googlebot can index it without executing JavaScript.
